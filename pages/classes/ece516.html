                                <p>ECE516 is aimed primarily at third and fourth year undergraduates, and first year graduate students. 4th year undergraduates often take this course as their "other technical elective" (fourth year elective). The classes are comprised of lectures and labs (labs have both a tutorial component and a grading component, etc.) starting in January, along with a final exam in April. The course provides the student with the fundamental knowledge needed in the rapidly growing field of Personal Cybernetics ("minds and machines", e.g. mind-machine interfaces, etc.) and Personal Intelligent Image Processing. These topics are often referred to colloquially as ``Wearable Computing'', ``Personal Technologies'', ``Mobile Multimedia'', etc..</p>

                                <p>The course focuses on the future of computing and what will become the most important aspects of truly personal computation and communication. Very quickly we are witnessing a merging of communications devices (such as portable telephones) with computational devices (personal organizers, personal computers, etc.).</p>

                                <p>The focus of this course is on the specific and fundamental aspects of visual interfaces that will have greatest relevence and impact, namely the notion of a computationally mediated reality, as well as related topics such as Digital Eye Glass, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), etc., as explored in collaboration with some of our startups, such as Meta, and InteraXon, a spinoff company started by former students from this course.</p>


                                <p>A computationally mediated reality is a natural extension of next--generation computing. In particular, we have witnessed a pivotal shift from mainframe computers to the personal/personalizable computers owned and operated by individual end users. We have also witnessed a fundamental change in the nature of computing from large mathematical calculations, to the use of computers primarily as a communications medium. The explosive growth of the Internet, and more recently, the World Wide Web, is a harbinger of what will evolve into a completely computer--mediated world in which all aspects of life, not just cyberspace, will be online and connected by visually based content and visual reality user interfaces.</p>

                                <p>This transformation in the way we think and communicate will not be the result of so--called ubiquitous computing (microprocessors in everything around us). Instead of the current vision of ``smart floors'', ``smart lightswitches'', ``smart toilets'', in ``smart buildings'' that watch us and respond to our actions, what we will witness is the emergence of ``smart people'' --- intelligence attached to people, not just to buildings.</p>

                                <p>This gives rise to what Ray Kurzweil (Chief Enginering of Google), Marvin Minsky (Father of Artificial Intelligence), and I refer to as the "Sensory Singularity".</p>

                                <p>And this will be done, not by implanting devices into the brain, but, rather, simply by non--invasively ``tapping'' the highest bandwidth ``pipe'' into the brain, namely the eye. This so--called ``eye tap'' forms the basis for devices that are currently built into eyeglasses (prototypes are also being built into contact lenses) to tap into the mind's eye.</p>

                                <p>
                                    EyeTap technology is not merely about a computer screen inside eyeglasses, but, rather, it's about enabling what is, in effect, a shared telepathic experience connecting multiple individuals together in a collective consciousness.</p>


                                <p>EyeTap technology will have many commercial applications, and emerge as one of the most industrially relevant forms of communications technology. The WearTel (TM) phone, for example, uses EyeTap technology to allow individuals to see each other's point of view. Traditional videoconferencing merely provides a picture of the other person. But most of the time we call people we already know, so it is far more useful for use to exchange points of view. Therefore, the miniature laser light source inside the WearTel eyeglass--based phone scans across the retinas of both parties and swaps the image information, so that each person sees what the other person is looking at. The WearTel phone, in effect, let's someone ``be you'', rather than just ``see you''. By letting others put themselves in your shoes and see the world from your point of view, a very powerful communications medium results.</p>

                                <p>The course includes iPhone and Android phone technologies, and eyeglass-based "eyePhone" hybrids.</p>

                    <p>Labs were organized according to these six units (the first unit on KEYER, etc., includes more than one lab, because there is some intro material, background, getting started, etc.).</p>

                    <p>Organization of the course usually follows the six chapters in the course <a href="http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471406376.html">textbook</a>, but if you are interested in other material please bring this to the attention of the course instructor or TA and we'll try and incorporate your interests into the course design.
